# Decentralised Split

A Split Dapp where you can create a split, add borrowers, deposit collateral, make payments, levy penalty and withdraw collateral.

A uniuqe feature is you can add collateral, wherein if a borrower agrees to a split agreement with collateral mentioned, then after lock time passes and the borrower has yet not paid the split creator can levy penalty on the borrower by withdrawing the collateral deposited by the borrower against the split agreement.

Why this feature ?!? Well imagine you went out with an aquaintance and made a split but they never paid. Having Nostalgia right :)

Only ERC20 tokens can be deposited and used as payment and collateral.
